**Symmetry Financial Group**, the fastest growing insurance marketing organization in the U.S. is headquartered in Asheville, NC, our agents are located across the United States. Our agency management team has over 50 years of industry experience and we offer a variety of financial and insurance solutions leveraging the very best providers in the country.

Our professional approach - comprehensive training system - coupled with qualified leads - spur our success and instigated Symmetry Financial Group's growth from a few hundred thousand dollars in sales in 2009 to over $35 million in 2015\. We are currently on pace to surpass 50 million this year and 100 million in sales in the next few years! Even with our continued growth, we still place a focus on our agents and their families. Family time is important to us, and we seek those who value time with their families. A great career should not include working your life away, and we place a top priority on helping you achieve the proper work/life balance, all while earning top-level income. Apply now, as we would love to have you become part of our family!

We want our agents to grow and succeed in their business, and we believe the best way to do this is to simplify the process. By removing the burdens and complications of everything from leads management, contracting paperwork, and writing new business, to how to market and grow your own agency, we allow you to spend less time behind the scenes, and more time doing what you do best: making sales!

**The Leads Department is The Cornerstone of Symmetry Financial Group:** Their purpose is to streamline the sales process by placing each agent in front of buyers, thus eliminating the need for prospecting. Through this venue, agents enter their request for leads using our custom Opt! System. From the very first phone call until the final sale and application submittal, our sophisticated CRM Software allows agents to manage their client database.

Our knowledgeable staff is here to assist agents in purchasing the leads that best fit their business, and it is our first priority to set up each agent for success with professionalism and dedication. Unlike other companies that purchase leads from an outside source, at SFG we own the entire lead generation process, from data research to mailing. This means that a lead purchased from us hasn't been sold to 10 other agents! Our leads go only to our agents and are not sold on the open market. Let's face it, there's no money in cold calling. Your money is made by selling.

Using the industry's most aggressive direct mail campaign, Symmetry Financial Group has created the key to putting you in front of families that need your help. Make no mistake though, we are in the business of selling insurance and not selling leads! This means that our agents pay exactly what the leads cost us to produce or less.

CONTRACTING: Our Contracting Department at Symmetry Financial Group acts as the bridge between our agency managers and our insurance carriers. They provide our newly recruited agents with access to the leads software and the SFG website training. The Contracting Department also submits contracting to carriers. This allows agents to sell a large variety of products from several carriers.
