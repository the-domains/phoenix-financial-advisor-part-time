_We want our agents to grow and succeed in their business, and we believe the best way to do this is to simplify the process. By removing the burdens and complications of everything from leads management, contracting paperwork, and writing new business, to how to market and grow your own agency, we allow you to spend less time behind the scenes, and more time doing what you do best: making sales!_

**LEADS**

The Leads Department is a cornerstone of Symmetry Financial Group. Their purpose is to streamline the sales process by placing each agent in front of buyers, thus eliminating the need for prospecting. Through this venue, agents enter their request for leads using our custom Opt! system. From the very first phone call until the final sale and application submittal, our sophisticated CRM software allows agents to manage their lead and client database. Our friendly and knowledgeable staff is here to assist agents in purchasing the leads that best fit their business, and it is our first priority to set up each agent for success with professionalism and dedication. Unlike other companies that purchase leads from an outside source, at SFG we own the entire lead generation process, from data research to mailing. This means that a lead purchased from us hasn't been sold to 10 other agents! Our leads go only to our agents and are not sold on the open market. Let's face it, there's no money in cold calling. Your money is made by selling. Using the industry's most aggressive direct mail campaign, Symmetry Financial Group has created the key to putting you in front of families that need your help. Make no mistake though, we are in the business of selling insurance and not selling leads! This means that our agents pay exactly what the leads cost us to produce or less.

**MARKETING**

The Marketing Department has their hands in almost everything that happens at SFG. From a content standpoint, the Marketing Department handles the social media, newsletters, email blasts, and most of the content on our website. They work closely with the Recruiting Department to manage the advertising channels associated with recruiting and SFG as a whole. They also work with the AV Department and assist with event planning (National & Leadership Conferences, Training Events, Corporate Meetings, etc.). Most of the overall look and design of Symmetry Financial Group, from logos to leaderboards, is thanks to the talent that exists within our Marketing Department.

**CONTRACTING**

Our Contracting Department at Symmetry Financial Group acts as the bridge between our agency managers and our insurance carriers. They provide our newly recruited agents with access to the leads software and the SFG website, where they can find training tools and more. The Contracting Department also submits contracting to carriers. This allows agents to sell a variety of products to potential clients.

**NEW BUSINESS**

The New Business Department's main goal is to work with agents to ensure applications are issued in a timely manner. New Business monitors and keeps track of agents' APV numbers, and they notify the Contracting Department of agents who have written business and need contracting. They also submit an agent's first application per carrier and notify agents of any pending issues once the application reaches the carrier.
